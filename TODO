perl:
	- ?server_verify does not let the browser plugin know if an error occurred
	  in decryption.
	- GnuPG-Interface is clunky and kind of blows, should find a replacement
	- Math::Random::Secure has lots of dependencies. Apparantly 
	  Math::Random::ISAAC seeded with Math::TrulyRandom could also work, and
	  with much less dependencies.
	- Keep track of User-Agent string when issuing a cookie, then make sure it
	  matches on every request w/ that cookie.


php:
	- mysql dependency is hard to swallow and not needed for basic setups.
